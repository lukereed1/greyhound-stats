            <p><strong>Class:</strong> Shows the grade change from the dog's last start to today's race. A dog moving from a higher to a lower number (e.g., 4→5) is dropping down in class, which can be a significant advantage.</p>
            <p><strong>Running Style:</strong> Classifies dogs as Early (frontrunners who lead from the start), Mid (take lead after first bend), or Close (finishers who come from behind). Early pace dogs win ~35% of races.</p>
            <p><strong>Box Pref:</strong> Indicates how this box draw suits the dog's historical performance. Green (Good) = running from their best-performing box group, Yellow (Neutral) = acceptable, Red (Poor) = running from a box group where they perform significantly worse.</p>
            <p><strong>Box Bias %:</strong> The historical win percentage for all greyhounds starting from this specific box at this specific track.</p>
            <p><strong>Lead @ 1st %:</strong> The percentage of races where this dog leads at the first bend. Higher percentages indicate strong early speed.</p>
            <p><strong>Trainer %:</strong> The trainer's win strike-rate from all recorded starts in the database.</p>
            <p><strong>Total Runs:</strong> The dog's total number of career starts.</p>
            <p><strong>Win % / Place %:</strong> The dog's overall career win and place (top 3) percentages.</p>
            <p><strong>Trk/Dist Exp:</strong> The number of previous starts this dog has had at this specific track (`Trk Exp`) and over this specific distance (`Dist Exp`). A higher number indicates more experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Win/Place @ Track:</strong> Win and place percentages specifically at this track.</p>
            <p><strong>Win/Place @ Dist:</strong> Win and place percentages at this specific distance regardless of track.</p>
            <p><strong>Avg T/D L5:</strong> The dog's average time over its last 5 starts at this specific Track and Distance.</p>
            <p><strong>Avg T/D vs Field:</strong> Compares the dog's "Avg T/D L5" to the average of all other active runners in this race. Negative green number = faster than field average.</p>
            <p><strong>Avg Spl L5:</strong> The dog's average first split time over its last 5 starts at this specific Track and Distance.</p>
            <p><strong>Avg Spl vs Field:</strong> Compares the dog's "Avg Spl L5" to the average of all other active runners in this race. Negative green number = faster early speed than the field.</p>
